👉 [Absendo Backend Repository](https://github.com/notacodes/absendo-backend)

## 🛠️ Installation & Local Setup

To get a local copy of Absendo up and running for development, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm (comes with Node.js)
*   [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli)
*   Docker Desktop (must be running while Supabase runs)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/notacodes/absendo-react.git
cd absendo-react
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the local Supabase environment

Make sure Docker Desktop is running before executing this command. This command starts the local Supabase database and provides you with the necessary API keys.

```bash
supabase start
```

After the command completes, you will see output similar to this:

```
Started supabase local development setup.

         API URL: http://127.0.0.1:54321
     GraphQL URL: http://127.0.0.1:54321/graphql/v1
  S3 Storage URL: http://127.0.0.1:54321/storage/v1/s3
         MCP URL: http://127.0.0.1:54321/mcp
    Database URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://127.0.0.1:54323
     Mailpit URL: http://127.0.0.1:54324
 Publishable key: sb_publishable_ACJWlzQHlZj...
      Secret key: sb_secret_N7UND0UgjKTVK...
   S3 Access Key: 625729a08b95bf...
   S3 Secret Key: 850181e4652dd023b7a98c...
       S3 Region: local
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. Copy the **API URL** and **anon key** from the `supabase start` output into this file.

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-publishable-key-from-previous-step
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the React development server, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Stopping the Supabase Environment

When you are finished with your development session, you can stop the local Supabase services.

```bash
supabase stop
```
